A comprehensive tracker for 100Devs classes and homework.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Pug, Tailwind CSS

This app was built from scratch using my [authentication boilerplate](https://github.com/labrocadabro/node-mongo-boilerplate/) as the base for the code, and [my previous homework tracker](https://labrocadabro.github.io/100devs-hw-tracker/) as the base for the application design.

## Optimizations and Improvements:

- Tests & refactoring to make unit tests easier.
- Possibly switching the front end to React + Typescript.
- Progress bars to show how much of the course has been completed.
- API integrations to automatically check if certain tasks (like Twitter check-in) have been completed.
- Video timestamps.
- Note-taking alongside the videos.

## Lessons Learned:

- This is the largest project I've built so far, and certain parts of it were new to me. First, second, and even third attempts sometimes felt wrong - too complex, difficult to read, or slow to execute. I learned that this gut feeling is usually right, but it's also ok to move on temporarily rather than dwelling on a single problem.
