	p.mb-2 This is an extension of the original #[a(target="_blank" href="https://labrocadabro.github.io/100devs-hw-tracker/") #100Devs Homework Tracker] that I made when I was starting out in the program. 
	p This tracker is currently in beta, but I believe the core functionality is stable and you shouldn't need to worry about losing any progress you record here.

	p If you were using my previous homework tracker, it is now possible to import your progress on the #[a(href="/account") settings page].
